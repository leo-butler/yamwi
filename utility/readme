Yamwi can be launched on Linux using only php (assuming a localhost is up and running).
After copying the Yamwi files in a user directory named yamwi (for example)
The commands used are :
cd $yamwi
mkdir tmp (if tmp not exist in the yamwi directory)
php -S localhost:8080
then open your brower at the address  : localhost:8080

The Yamwi launcher is a little utility which graphically execute these various commands.
You can use :
* the python script launch-yamwi by the command (python3  launch-yamwi.py)
* or directly double-clic on the linux binary : launch-yamwi
After launching the software:
1) Choose the folder with the Yamwi files
2) Click 'Launch Maxima Online'
and the brower will open with a Yamwi session ready.
To quit, close the browser tab, click on Shutdown Maxima Online.
Of course, click on Quit to exit the program.

IMPORTANT NOTE : these files are not necessary for the Yamwi software.
You do not need to copy them to the server or the Yamwi files folder.
Just copy the launch-yamwi binary wherever you prefer in your user directory.
